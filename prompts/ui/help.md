Hi! I convert times between timezones.

Just mention a time (3pm, 15:00, "at 5 in the evening") and I'll show it in all team timezones.

First time I'll ask for your city to determine your timezone.

Moving to a new city? Just write "relocated to [city]" or "moved to [city]" and I'll update your timezone.
